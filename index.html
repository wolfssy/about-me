    <p>   The second time I was pushed to my limits was in 2013. I was in my first amateur fight in Muay Thai and matched against my close friend.  He took it as an opportunity to hit me as hard as he could.  I had to look into myself to see him as the enemy for the meantime and find a solution.  I found his weak spot and won the match by first round TKO.  That gave me a new perspective to solving a problem without bias.</p>

    <p> The third even took place in my own head.  I was on my last deployment with the worst leaders and coworkers anyone could ask for.  Unfortunately, rank hierarchy prevented me from giving them their due justice and I had to find a way of coping with it.  That's when I found poetry.  I was able to write down everything I had bottled up and over the years found better ways to make it all sound better.  Poetry helps me remain calm and keep my emotions to myself so I can maintain a professional profile and get a job done. </p>
